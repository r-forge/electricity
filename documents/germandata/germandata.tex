\section{Data}

The German electricity market was liberalized in 1998 and is the largest in Europe with a gross production of of 633.2 TWh in 2006 \citep{IEA2007}. More than half of the power is generated with coal, other major sources are nuclear and gas. The German power market is dominated by a few large players (E.ON, RWE, EnBW, Vattenfall). These firms are both transmission system operators and own 90\% of total generation capacity. \cite{Brunekreeft2006} report values for Herfindahl Hirschman Index (HHI)\footnote{This is a common measure of market power and is calculated as sum of the squared market shares in an industry.} of over 2000. Electricity distribution is organized by approximately 900 communal distributors. The German energy market regulator  \emph{Bundesnetzagentur} was installed in 2005. Germany decided on a phase-out of nuclear power generation by 2020. The \emph{German Energy Agency} estimates that investments in generation capacity of up to 40,000 MW will be necessary, see Fig. \ref{fig:nuclear}.

The major stake of electricity trading is done in OTC markets for which it is hard to obtain data. Exchange prices from the EEX can be used as a good approximation. We see the expected positive relationship when comparing the exchange prices to the actual electricity demand per hour.

To account for different states of the market we separated the price-quantity combinations which occurred within a year by prices. As can be seen in Table \ref{tab:demand}, markets with extremely high prices occur only seldom and prices between 20 and 40 are most common. For each of the six states in which the market might be we created linear demand functions based on average prices and quantities in these states. Note that in order to account for price spikes we model the high-price end of the market quite accurately. To construct demand curves, \cite{Neuhoff2005} use a demand elasticity of 0.1, whereby \cite{Genc2007} argue that 0.2 is more commonly used to simulate the electricity market. As we have a more long run focus we decided to use 0.2 as in the long run, elasticity is higher. It might be argued, that in an electricity market, there is no elasticity anyway as maybe only a very few industrial clients reduce their demand as prices rise. Responding to this, \cite{Bushnell2003} notes that imports and exports provide some elasticity.

%\subsection{Supply}

Data concerning the short run marginal costs and investment costs per MWh were obtained from \cite[p.46]{Auer2006} and are shown in Table \ref{tab:costs}. For pump storage plants we used the real option value of peak load electricity which we approximated by the average option price for peak load electricity at the EEX in the year 2006. We do not provide fixed costs for pump hydropower and oil plants. In the case of hydropower plants construction costs depend heavily on the respective sites and so such costs are hard to estimate. Furthermore, all available sites for significant hydropower capacities in Central Europe seem to be occupied already. Oil fired plants are not considered a relevant investment option because oil prices are just too high. The fixed investment costs we use could also be interpreted as a discounted present value of future yearly costs of capital so our analysis is general concerning this point.
