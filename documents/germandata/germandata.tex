\section{Data}

The German electricity market was liberalized in 1998 and is the largest in Europe with a gross production of of 633.2 TWh in 2006 \citep{IEA2007}. More than half of the power is generated with coal, other major sources are nuclear and gas. The German power market is dominated by a few large players (E.ON, RWE, EnBW, Vattenfall). These firms are both transmission system operators and own 90\% of total generation capacity. \cite{Brunekreeft2006} report values for Herfindahl Hirschman Index (HHI)\footnote{This is a common measure of market power and is calculated as sum of the squared market shares in an industry.} of over 2000. Electricity distribution is organized by approximately 900 communal distributors. The German energy market regulator  \emph{Bundesnetzagentur} was installed in 2005. Germany decided on a phase-out of nuclear power generation by 2020. The \emph{German Energy Agency} estimates that investments in generation capacity of up to 40,000 MW will be necessary, see Fig. \ref{fig:nuclear}.

The capacities of the four major electricity generators can be found in Tab. \ref{tab:majorcapacities}.

The major stake of electricity trading is done in OTC markets for which it is hard to obtain data. Exchange prices from the EEX can be used as a good approximation. We see the expected positive relationship when comparing the exchange prices to the actual electrcity demand per hour.
