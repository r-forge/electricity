\section{The economics of wholesale electricity markets} \label{sect:3}

\subsection{Supply function equilibria vs. market states}

\cite{Klemperer1989} show that when a firm faces a range of possible residual demand curves, which is actually the case in electricity markets, the expected profit can be increased by not just offering one quantity or price, but a schedule which sets a price for each possible demand that might materialize. The equilibrium arising from such behavior is called a supply function equilibrium (SFE). On an electricity wholesale market such behavior is clearly possible. \cite{Green1992} apply this model to the British electricity spot market at which bids have to be submitted for a whole day. At the EEX however, bids can be submitted one day ahead for every hour of the day allowing generators to forecast demand with a high degree of accuracy. By considering enough possible future market states, one can thereby overcome much of this disadvantage a traditional Cournot model has compared to the SFE approach. For example, a firm could set quantities offered to be optimal for a typical eight o'clock winter morning market or a typical summer nighttime market. Given bounded rationality, such behavior might even be more realistic than the rather complex SFE Approach.

\subsection{Peak-load pricing under perfect competition}

In electricity markets, demand varies from hour to hour and as electricity is not storable, it has to be met at any time of the day. If capacities are a binding constraint, there has to be rationing by rising prices. Of course, such rationing causes welfare to decrease. On the other hand however, there are capacity costs. The literature on peak load pricing provides results on how to balance these two effects optimally \citep[see][]{Crew1986}. Under perfect competition, prices will be set to marginal costs in low demand periods, such that variable costs ($v$) are equal to the price ($p$), and marginal costs plus a scarcity rent in high demand periods. Under the assumption that there are fixed capacity costs $(c)$ how much capacity $(K)$ should be built, taking into account that demand is not always high and there is a chance of $\pi$ to have high demand. The premium of the market price in peak periods ($p^p$) over marginal costs in peak periods, multiplied with the chance of actually having a period of high demand, reflects the value of increasing capacity by one unit. In off-peak periods, the corresponding premium equals zero, reflecting the fact that in such states capacity is of no value. The value of increasing capacity by one unit must equal capacity costs per unit. If the condition

$$(p^p-v)\times\pi=c$$

is met, social surplus is maximized and costs are minimized. A profit maximizing firm under perfect competition would invest until exactly this condition is satisfied. So under perfect competition, one could rely on the market to provide optimal incentives for capacity investments. However, this does not mean that prices should always be equal to marginal costs, as during peak periods firms must be allowed to cover their investment costs by scarcity rents.

If capacity is binding, the price of electricity is equal to the willingness to pay of the marginal consumer. So please note, that we do not account for possible outages or rationing costs although this is discussed in the literature.

\subsection{Peak-load pricing under imperfect competition}

How optimal incentives to invest are distorted by an oligopolistic situation is shown in \cite{Fehr1995}. If there is market power, the above mentioned optimality result does not necessarily hold as prices above marginal costs may induce overinvestments. The situation of too high prices is depicted in Figure \ref{peak_load_toohigh}.

\end{figure}

On the other hand, firms might have an incentive to reduce investments, thereby driving up the price in peak periods and increasing their profits. Of course this only works if there are barriers to entry beyond the unit costs of investment. The effect of lower than optimal investments is depicted in Figure \ref{peak_load_insufficient}.

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

We will now use the example from \cite{Fehr1995} to illustrate the two competing effects.
While the socially optimal incentive to invest is still the same as above, a firm in an oligopolistic situation gets the following expected revenue per unit of investment:

\begin{equation*}
	\frac{1}{2} (1-\pi) (p^{op}-v) + \pi \left(w^p(K)+\frac{\partial w^p(K^*)}{\partial q}-v\right) - c
\end{equation*}

The first part of the equation stands for possible gains of the investment that might occur during low peak periods. For simplicity we assume that there is a duopoly and a probability of $1/2$ for a new unit of capacity to be utilized. This is then multiplied by the probability to not have a peak period (1-\pi) and the oligopoly price minus variable costs $(p^{op}-v)$. In such periods it is possible to steal business, you would normally not have, from another firm. Such an effect can create an additional incentive to invest in capacity. %As we shall see later on, this effect can be called a strategic effect of investments as well.

The second part of the equation stands for what the investing firm looses in peak periods due to the investment. This equation is essentially the same as the condition we derived for perfect competition. The only difference is that we now write the peak price as a function of the binding capacity $p^p(K)$ and that this price now changes with capacity (and thereby quantity) changes which are illustrated by $\frac{\partial w^p(K^*)}{\partial q}$. This term measures the reduction in the peak price which is due to the decreased scarcity of capacity. This effect has to be taken into account now, as we switched from perfect competition to oligopoly.

So if the loss firms expect due to losses in the peak load market price are bigger than the gains due to more market share in off peak periods, firms will underinvest as their incentive to invest is smaller than the optimal level under perfect competition. Of course, if the effect doe to business stealing is higher, firms will overinvest. So in an oligopolistic setting, firms will in general not choose an optimal level of investments and it cannot be said by means of a purely algebraic model whether they will over- or underinvest.


%To be able to assess the strength of the different effects, we set up a realistic numerical model in the next section. %As we shall see later on, in a two stage game, strategic effects can be accounted for in different ways which has an effect on the predictions made.

%\subsection{Optimal Technology Mix}

%If demand were certain and constant, only one technology (the one which reaches the lowest possible costs in a standard cost minimization problem with capacity costs and operating costs as inputs) would be used \citep[see][pg. 183]{Chao1983}. This can be seen in the following graph (\ref{technology_choice_chow}) in which a standard cost minimization problem with capacity costs and operating costs as inputs and different technologies are shown. The minimal cost combination given input prices would be technology one. But when demand is uncertain or variable and the output is nonstorable some idle capacity becomes inevitable. This makes less capital intensive technologies such as 2 and 3 more attractive which would be dominated without fluctuations. However, all technologies which are not on the lower envelope are still inferior.

%\end{figure}

%\cite{sherali1982} present a graphical illustration on how to find the optimal mix of different technologies if demand varies. Figure \ref{technology_choice_sherali} \textbf{b} shows the so - called load duration curve which plots the hours of the year ordered according to their energy demand. It can be seen, that only during a few hours of the year demand is very high. Figure \ref{technology_choice_sherali} \textbf{a} shows the cost curves of three different technologies. Technology three has low yearly fixed costs ($c_3$) and high variable costs ($f_3$) so if it would be used for more than $\alpha_{23}$ hours in a year it would be cheaper to use technology two instead. For most of the time of the year, it is actually cheaper to use technology one only which has fairly high fixed but low variable costs. The condition of when one technology becomes cheaper than the other is the same than the one derived by \cite{chow1983} (who also adds an additional stochastic element however). This condition for an optimal technology mix has first been advanced by \cite{Turvey1968}. Also \cite{Pineau2007} uses this condition.

%\begin{eqnarray}
%	c_1 + f_1 \alpha_{12} = c_2 + f_2 \alpha_{12}
%	\alpha_{12} = \frac{c_2-c_1}{f_1-f_2}
%\end{eqnarray}

%This so called optimal running time can be translated into optimal investments into capacity of technology one two and three as can be seen in figure \ref{technology_choice_sherali} \textbf{b}.

%\end{figure}

%What can be seen here is that which kind of capacity is optimal to be built depends on where demand actually increases. It is an unresolved issue whether competition and markets, be it perfect competition or imperfect forms alter the technology mix firms have an incentive to install in any way.
