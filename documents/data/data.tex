\section{Data}

Austrian and German electricity market are integrated. Therefore, we need data for the major players in both countries. There are no serious network congestions on the border between Austria and Germany. (for reference see Todem)

For the supply we need for every player

\begin{itemize}
\item variable and fixed costs,
\item structure of the plant park.
\end{itemize}

Parameters for the demand curve are obtained from

\begin{itemize}
\item load duration curve
\item how parameters for demand functions from load duration curve
\end{itemize}

Show that Austrian players are fringe? 

Long term structure of plant parks.

How does the resulting plant park structure look like, if firms actually play two-stage open or closed-looped games and other possible market structures (perfect competition, Betrand). 

How could the current market structures look like one long term step ahead (in ten years from now, one investment cycle).

Welfare implications from different market structures.

Implications of capacity markets.
