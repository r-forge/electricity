	As different definitions are used worldwide, the paper briefly discusses
	the definition of DG. The future development of DG, however, will,
	to a not insignificant part, depend on the legal framework. As the
	legal framework can vary significantly for different competitive
	electricity markets, this paper briefly identifies and analyses some
	variations in the regulatory approaches, e.g. for power exchanges,
	balance services and ancillary services, in different countries.
	It also illustrates the influence of market regulations on the development
	of distributed power generation. Based on this analysis, it can be
	concluded that regulatory aspects might decisively influence the
	development of distributed power generation},

  abstract = {Production costing models (PCMs) have been extensively used to analyze
	traditional power systems for decades. These tools are based on the
	costs of production, but in oligopolistic electricity markets market
	prices can not be explained attending just to marginal costs but
	instead bid prices have to be considered, since market participants
	seize their dominant position in the market looking for higher profits.
	Thus, the merit order composition criteria applied in traditional
	PCMs has to be somehow reconsidered in order to be able to represent
	the agents' strategic bidding. The objective of the strategic production
	costing model (SPCM) presented in this paper is to evolve the PCM
	approach to adapt it to the actual wholesale electricity markets
	without losing its typical advantages. The generalization proposed
	allows to represent an oligopolistic hydrothermal electricity market
	and provides the system price-duration curve as well as the income
	and expected costs of every generating agent. Compared with other
	oligopolistic models, the main advantage of the SPCM is its potential
	computational speed, which makes it very suitable for risk analysis

  abstract = {Abstract.&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition has been introduced in the electricity
	markets with the goal of reducing prices and improving efficiency.
	The basic idea which stays behind this choice is that, in competitive
	markets, a greater quantity of the good is exchanged at a lower price,
	leading to higher market efficiency. Electricity markets are pretty
	different from other commodities mainly due to the physical constraints
	related to the network structure that may impact the market performance.
	The network structure of the system on which the economic transactions
	need to be undertaken poses strict physical and operational constraints.
	Strategic interactions among producers that game the market with
	the objective of maximizing their producer surplus must be taken
	into account when modeling competitive electricity markets. The physical
	constraints, specific of the electricity markets, provide additional
	opportunity of gaming to the market players. Game theory provides
	a tool to model such a context. This paper discussed the application
	of game theory to physical constrained electricity markets with the
	goal of providing tools for assessing the market performance and
	pinpointing the critical network constraints that may impact the
	market efficiency. The basic models of game theory specifically designed

	is formulated by simultaneous consideration that any of the variables
	that affect price formation-such as hydro inflows, demand, or fuel
	prices-are stochastic, by representing them through a scenario tree.
	It is shown that this equilibrium formulation can be solved by means
	of an equivalent optimization problem, which in most common cases
	becomes a quadratic programming problem. This schema enables taking
	advantage of the properties of classical medium-term operation optimization
	models, including clear model structure, reasonable computing solving
	time, and easy obtaining of dual-information. An annual study case
	(inspired by the Spanish electricity market) is presented, including
	two alternative demand levels in summer and three hydro-inflow situations,
	both in spring and autumn. In addition to the advantages previously
	mentioned, this approach provides richer results than a deterministic
	one, allowing companies to fit their policies more accurately to
	reality, thereby avoiding, for example, excessively optimistic or
	pessimistic decisions proposed by the deterministic analysis},

	markets, considering forward contracts and the operating reserve

	of permits, there could be interaction between market power in the
	permits and energy markets. Market power in the energy market is
	modeled using a Cournot game, while a conjectured price response
	model is used in the permits market. An illustrative application
	is made to Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM),
	which we represent by a 14-node dc load-flow model, and the USEPA
	Ozone Transport Commission NO/sub x/ Budget Program. The results
	show that forward contracts effectively mitigate market power in
	PJM energy market and both simulated solutions of perfect and Cournot
	(oligopoly) competition are a good approximation to actual prices
	in 2000, except that the Cournot model yielded higher peak prices.
	The NO/sub x/ market influences the Cournot energy market in several
	ways. One is that Cournot competition lowers the price of NO/sub
	x/ permits, which in turn affects on low- and high-emission producers
	differently. In general, because pollution permits are an important
	cost, high concentration in the market for such permits can exacerbate

	This result suggests that even in an increasingly volatile market,
	players may have an incentive to participate in the market. The key
	to our approach is the so-called scenario formulation of stochastic
	programming. In addition to several modeling insights, we also discuss
	the application of GPS to the electricity market in Ontario, Canada.
	The examples presented in this paper illustrate that this approach
	can address dynamic games that are clearly out of reach for dynamic

	an independent system operator dispatches power solving an optimal

	that wish to obtain (sell) power at prices that are more stable than
	those typically seen in electricity markets. Only a limited variety
	of forward contracts are available on the market so the need is for
	a ?custom? contract that meets a specific profile of electricity
	requirements (usually uncertain) over time. This paper develops stochastic
	programming models that can be used by the supplier of a custom contract
	to design a procurement strategy that minimizes its expected costs
	of supply in meeting contract obligations. The procurement strategy
	will consist of a mix of forwards available in the market, and, in
	each period, blending its own generation with spot purchases of power.
	The model also integrates spot selling of power. We consider that
	expected spot prices and forward prices may disagree since electricity
	is not storable, creating apparent arbitrage opportunities. We bound
	the transaction amounts to limit effects of apparent arbitrage and
	for consistency with the assumption of constant variable generation
	costs and market prices. For sample cases we compute the optimal
	procurement strategy, demonstrate the magnitude of the saving, and
	illustrate the sensitivity of this saving to the magnitude of the†upper

	The second model (open-loop Cournot game) extends the Cournot model

	be interpreted as describing investments in an oligopolistic market

	integration between generators and retailers on generation capacity
	choice and its subsequent welfare consequences. We present a framework
	in which final demand is perfectly inelastic and stochastic. Nevertheless,
	wholesale demand is elastic because of the existence of outside opportunities
	(mainly international transmission capacity). The model is a three-stage
	game. Neither transmission nor retail costs are taken into account.
	In the first stage of the game, generators choose capacity only knowing
	distribution of demand and thus maximizing their expected profit.
	The second stage of the game represents the competition for market
	share between retailers in a market where consumers have switching
	costs. The former face unknown demand and maximize their utility
	based on two factors: the expected profit and a risk element. Finally,
	generators submit bid functions to the system operator given known
	demand and maximizing their profit during the last stage of the game.
	Retailers and generators interact in the wholesale market, which
	is cleared by the system operator whose function is to match supply
	(represented by the bids of the generators) and demand through a
	system of single price auctions. The wholesale market is the only
	means to buy and sell energy; there are no bilateral contracts between
	firms, except if they are vertically integrated. We compare fully
	disintegrated and partially vertically integrated structures using
	a comparative statics approach. In this paper, the analysis will
	focus on the last stage of the game: the bidding game. We find that
	partial vertical integration between generators and retailers tends
	to lower wholesale prices but not unambiguously. Depending on which
	firm (vertically integrated or disintegrated generator) has installed
	the higher capacity and depending on level of demand, prices can
	stay unchanged or even rise.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the conceptual structure, properties, and solution
	approach of a computerized model of the international energy market.
	The model treats energy producers as players in a multistage, noncooperative
	game. The goal of each player (or cartel of players) is assumed to
	be maximization of discounted profit subject to technical, political,
	and resource constraints. The model calculates that collection of
	intertemporal extraction and price paths from which a player can
	unilaterally deviate only at a loss-the open-loop, Nash equilibrium.
	The model integrates the theory of exhaustible resources due to Hotelling
	and the theory of oligopoly due to Nash and Cournot. Although useful
	as a teaching device to illustrate theoretical results, its main
	function is to facilitate analysis of real-world resource problems.
	The model is flexible, allowing the user to specify not only cost,
	demand, and reserve information but also assumptions about who belongs
	to what coalition. Two shortcomings deserve note. The strategies
	of players are restricted to time-dated (open-loop) paths. Also,
	lags cannot be accommodated in the current version. The restriction
	of the strategy space significantly increases tractability and will
	permit the incorporation of lags and other complications in the future.
	The model was built under government contract and is in the public
	domain.},

	participants (power suppliers and large consumers) in a deregulated
	power market, which is more an oligopoly than a laissez-faire market.
	Each participant can increase his or her own profit through strategic
	bidding but this has a negative effect on maximising social welfare.
	A method to build bidding strategies for both power suppliers and
	large consumers in a poolco-type electricity market is presented
	in this paper. It is assumed that each supplier/large consumer bids
	a linear supply/demand function, and the system is dispatched to
	maximise social welfare. Each supplier/large consumer chooses the
	coefficients in the linear supply/demand function to maximise benefits,
	subject to expectations about how rival participants will bid. The
	problem is formulated as a stochastic optimisation problem, and solved
	by a Monte Carlo approach. A numerical example with six suppliers
	and two large consumers serves to illustrate the essential features
	of the method.},

	DSOs can overcome the threats that arise from the increasing penetration
	of DG, incentive regulation, regulated connection charges, and unbundling.

	the behaviors of electric power providers, the dynamic Cournot game

	and simulated numerically in different market parameters, in which

	out of the stability region of the Nash equilibrium.},

	conditions, when combined with market-clearing conditions give rise

	aspects are depicted by a recourse problem for each player in which
	the first-stage decisions relate to long-term contracts and the second-stage
	decisions relate to spot market activities for three seasons. Besides
	showing that such a market model is an instance of a MiCP, we provide
	theoretical results concerning long-term and spot market prices and
	solve the resulting MiCP for a small yet representative market. We
	also note an interesting observation for the value of the stochastic
