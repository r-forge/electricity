\section{Ideas}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \cite{Pineau2003} study how electricity prices, production levels and production capacities unfold in \emph{absence of regulation}. Why test different regulatory measures in this game theoretic setting?
	\item Can transmission pricing and constraints also be ignored in Austria?
	\item Parameters to check in sensitivity analysis: depreciation rate of generating capacity
\end{itemize}
