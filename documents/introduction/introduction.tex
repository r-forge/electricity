\section{Introduction}

With the ongoing deregulation of electricity markets firms behave different in this new market setting. When investing in new generation capacity firms are faced with uncertainties related to the future demand of electricity and to the investment and production decisions of their competitors. \cite{Ventosa2005} gives an overview about decision support models used in electricity market modeling. There exist two types of equilibrium models. First, Cournout competition where the players compete in quantity and second, supply function equilibria (SFE) where the firms compete over their offer curves. What both approaches have in common is that they are based on the concept of \cite{Nash1951} equilibra.

Electricity demand is uncertain and varies over time. The usual way to represent this fact is with a load duration curve. \cite{Murphy2005} convert the inverse to a probability density function and interpret it as a way to cope with the overall uncertainty about the future demand for electricity.

An important aspect of a dynamic oligopoly model is the assumption about the information structure. The literature disinguishes between the following three cases \citep[see, e.g.,][]{Cellini2004}. \emph{Open-loop} equilibria only take into account the inital state variables and the time, but they do not include any strategic interaction based on the evolution of the state variables over time. They are not subgame perfect, meaning that not in all stages the strategies have to be Nash equilibria, and players must commit to their decision forever.  \emph{Closed-loop} equilibra can only be found for special cases. \cite{Murphy2005} consider a two-stage game where they interpret the close-loop game as electricity industry with a spot market, where players make an investment decision in the first stage and know how they will play against each other when producing the electricity.


\cite{Pineau2003} argue that electricity generators stick to their investment decisions for some time while only adjusting for shocks in exogenous variables. Therefore, they think it is possible to gain some insight in the strategic behaviour with a model based on $S$-adapted open-loop equilibria. 

Instead of using the optimization criterion as in stochastic programming the Nash equilibrium computation is performed over the whole sample space so that players maximize their expected profit.

\cite{Neuhoff2005} analyze electricty markets with transmission constraints but their models are not multi-stage.

In this paper we will build a model for generation capacity investment under uncertainty. We consider a deregulated electricity market, where typically several large players act on market leading to an oligopoly situation. There is not much literature which directly deals with the question of  generation capacity investments. Recent works are \cite{Chuang2001}, \cite{Ventosa2002}, \cite{Chaton2003}, \cite{Hogendorn2003}, \cite{Pineau2003}, \cite{Ehrenmann2004}. \cite{Murphy2005}, \cite{Kiesling2007}, \cite{Pineau2007}.


Cournot is more flexible and better computational tractability.

The $S$-adapted information structure was introduced by \cite{Haurie1990}.
$S$-adapted structure is similar to the open-loop case, except that the strategies of the players adapt to the sample path of the stochastic variable \citep[see][pg. 128]{Pineau2003}.

\cite{Haurie2002} developed an approximation method with variational inequalities for $S$-adapted oligopoly equilibria. It can be used with any discrete state process that can be represented as an event tree can be used as description of the random disturbances.

\cite{Murto2004} solves the game with feedback information structure.

\subsection{Short-term assumption for decision variables}

Cournot, Bertrand, SFE


In theory, the output of a competitive generation market is equal to the output of a regulated system with a central planner that minimizes investment plus operating costs to meet demand (Green, 2000), see \citep[see][pg. 111]{Rothwell2003}.
