\subsection{The German electricity market}
\label{sec:germ-electr-mark}

The German electricity market was liberalized in 1998 and is the largest in Europe with a gross production of 633.2 TWh in 2006 \citep{IEA2007}. More than half of the power is generated with coal, other major sources are nuclear and gas. The German power market is dominated by a few large players (E.ON, RWE, EnBW, Vattenfall). These firms are transmission system operators and own 90\% of total generation capacity. \cite{Brunekreeft2006} report values for the Herfindahl Hirschman Index (HHI)\footnote{This is a common measure of market power and is calculated as sum of the squared market shares in an industry.} of over 2000. Electricity distribution is organized by approximately 900 communal distributors. The German energy market regulator  \emph{Bundesnetzagentur} was installed in 2005. There are several interesting developments on the German electricity market. For example, new capacities are urgently needed as Germany decided on a phase-out of nuclear power generation by 2020 \citep[see e.g.][]{IEA2007a}. In addition to that, a large stake of the existing generation capacities are close to the end of its service life. The \emph{German Energy Agency} estimates that investments in generation capacity of up to 40,000 MW will be necessary in the upcoming years. This, together with a tendency towards more environmental-friendly technologies supports the importance of exploring investment incentives in an oligopolistic market under uncertainity.
 
In the recent years, the price levels on German wholesale electricity markets have risen as reported by \cite{Weigt2007}, who attribute this development to market power. In a similar vein, \cite{Brunekreeft2005} argue that this price increase is now exercised on wholesale markets as transmission tariffs, which increases the regulatory pressure on the vertically integrated major players on the market.

\subsection{Available capacities}
\label{sec:available-capacities}

Apart from that, our analysis will abstract from vertical relationships and transmission constraints. According to \cite{IEA2007a}, there are no significant congestions within Germany. Cross boarder transfer capacities and congestions there are given in table \ref{tab:transfer} and help us to determine the relevant market. There seems to be no congestions at all between Germany and Austria, so we include the Austrian demand and fringe supply into our analysis. The heavily congested lines to Denmark and The Netherlands suggest that exports from Germany to the latter countries take place at maximum capacities almost all over the year, so we subtract the respective exports from the German supply. French and Czech capacities are added to the non-strategic fringe but only up to their import capacity constraint.

% Total final electricity consumption grew by 1.4 \% a year between 1990 and 2005 however, there are governmental plans to significantly increase energy efficiency and thereby halt demand growth (\cite{IEA2007a}) which adds some uncertainty on demand.

% Another important development is the introduction of the CO2 trading scheme. The emission abatement costs are relatively cheap in the electricity industry by switching from coal to gas generation, or from lignite to hard coal. This is why the price of CO2 has long been guessed to converge to the price of CO2 at which a coal plant would replaced by a gas plant. The best estimate we have right now for the future price of CO2 is the average EEX future price for the second CO2 trading period which lasts from 2008 to 2013 and is at 22.5 euro per tonne

\subsection{Market demand and electricity prices}
\label{sec:mark-demand-electr}

The major stake of electricity trading is done on over-the-counter (OTC) markets for which it is hard to obtain data. However, the European Energy Exchange (EEX) gains more and more importance. Market participants can bid in day-ahead hourly contract auctions, or can trade block contracts and emission permits in continuous trading. Prices from the EEX can be used as a good approximation for the wholesale price of electricity. Plotting the prices against the trading volumes does not show a strong correlation. We see the expected positive relationship when comparing the exchange prices to the actual electricity demand per hour, see fig. \ref{fig:pricequant}.

\end{figure}

To account for different states of the market, we separated the price-quantity combinations which occurred within a year by prices. As can be seen in table \ref{tab:marketsegments}, markets with extremely high prices occur only seldomly and prices between 20 and 40 are most common.

For each of the six states in which the market might be we created linear demand functions based on average prices and quantities in these states. Note, that we also model the high-price market segment, to include price spikes which are a stylized fact of electricity prices.  To construct demand curves, \cite{Neuhoff2005} use a demand elasticity of 0.1, whereby \cite{Genc2007} argue that 0.2 is more commonly used to simulate the electricity market. As we have a more long run focus, we decided to use the latter value. It might be argued, that electricity demand is completely inelastic, as maybe only a very few industrial clients reduce their demand when prices rise. In response to that, \cite{Bushnell2003} notes that imports and exports provide some elasticity.

\subsection{Marginal and investment costs}
\label{sec:marg-investm-costs}

Data concerning the short run marginal costs and investment costs per MWh were obtained from \cite{Auer2006} and are shown in Table \ref{tab:costs}. For pump storage plants we used the real option value of peak load electricity, which we approximated by the average option price for peak load electricity at the EEX in the year 2006. We do not provide fixed costs for pump hydropower and oil plants. In the case of hydropower plants construction costs depend heavily on the respective sites and therefore such costs are hard to estimate. Furthermore, all available sites for significant hydropower capacities in Central Europe seem to be occupied already. Oil fired plants are not considered a relevant investment option, because oil prices are just too high. The fixed investment costs can also be interpreted as present value of future yearly costs of capital.
