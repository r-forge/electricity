\abstract{
The paper discusses a game theoretic model for generation capacity investment decisions in a deregulated electricity market. We use a node-based formulation of a multi-stage stochastic program. The uncertainty is modeled as stochastic demand function with a random intercept for different states of the market. We present a practical application of this $S$-adapted Cournot equilibrium, were we use data from the German electricity market.
