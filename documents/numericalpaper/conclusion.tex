\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented a stochastic dynamic equilibrium model for the German electricity market. The multi-stage stochastic optimization problem was formulated with the so-called compact notation. The scenario generation was based on realistic price and electricity load data. The major contribution of this paper is the better approximation of the load duration curve, a more compact notation and the practical application example for the German electricity market. The results showed immediate investment incentives for the two smaller players in the market.

Further research could include the time evolution of costs and more detailed forecasts for the development of the electricity load.
