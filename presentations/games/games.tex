The duopoly Cournot model for an electricity Market from Murphy and Smeers (2005)
\begin{gather}
	\min_{x_i,y_i^s} \sum_s \left[ - \alpha^s + \beta (y_i^s+y_{-i}^s) \right] y_i^s + v_i \sum_s y_i^s + K_i x_i \\
\text{s.t.:} \  x_i-y_i^s \geq 0; \  y_i^s \geq 0; \ \nonumber
\end{gather}
{\small
\begin{tabbing}
whereby: \= $y_i^s$ \  \= output per player and demand segment \\
\> $x_i$   \    \> capacity  \\
\> $\alpha - \beta y$    \   \= inverse demand curve \\
\> $v_i, K_i$    \    \> variable and capacity costs
\end{tabbing}}
The first order conditions are:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial (- \pi)}{\partial y_i^s} = -\alpha^s + 2 \beta y_i^s +  y_{-i}^s + v_i + \lambda_i^s = \omega_i^s 
\end{equation}
By using the first order condition to obtain reaction functions, the mutual best responses can be found

We have to solve the problem now, under the assumption that the quantities in the second period are a function of investments in the first period $y_i^s(x_i;x_{-i})$.

\begin{equation}
	\min_{x_i} \sum_{s=1}^S \left[ - \alpha^s + \beta( y_i^s(x_i;x_{-i})+ y_{-i}^s(x_i;x_{-i})) + v_i \right] y_i^s(x_i;x_{-i}) + K_i x_i
\end{equation}

and the solution has to satisfy the following condition:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial (- \pi)}{\partial x_i} = \sum_s \left[-\alpha^s + 2 \beta y_i^s (\cdot) + \beta y_{-i}^s(\cdot) + v_i \right] \frac{\partial y_i^s (\cdot)}{\partial x_i} + \sum_s \beta y_i^s (\cdot) \frac{\partial y_{-i}^s (\cdot)}{\partial x_i} + K_i
\end{equation}

The effect of an investment of player $i$ on the action of player $-i$ in the second period $\partial y_{-i} (\cdot)/\partial x_i$ is now taken into account.
