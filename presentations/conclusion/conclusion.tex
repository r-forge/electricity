\begin{itemize}
	\item It is still an open question whether \emph{oligopolistic competition} can lead to an \emph{optimal technology mix}.
	\item Pineau (2003) achieved the result that the oligopolistic investment game in an \emph{$S$-adapted open-loop} setting leads to \emph{underinvestment}. %This might be different in a \emph{closed loop} solution.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Further research will compare strategic generation capacity investment games with different information structures, i.e. open-loop, closed-loop, $S$-adapted with an optimal technology mix under perfect competition. These results could be used to design regulatory measures, that try to obtain this mix under an imperfect competitive market structure.
	%\item An empirical model for the Austrian wholesale electricity market will test whether a closed-loop equilibrium leads also to underinvestment as in Pineau (2003).
